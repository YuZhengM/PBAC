# PBAC

> PBAC is a powerful tool to predict drug responsiveness based on the biology pathway information and explore the potential cancer-driving pathways.

> The Model module constructs the PBAC model.

> The GetMaskedFile module constructs a mask matrix based on the relationship between genes and pathways.

> The across-study module validates four types of chemotherapy drugs and validates immune therapy across datasets.

> The Within-study module performs cross-validation on immune therapy datasets. 

> The Model_D_across, MOLI, RF_across, and SVM_across modules compare methods.

> The Model_withoutAtten and Model_withoutMask modules are for ablation experiments.
